<h2 style="padding-left:20px">Ingridients and Subsititutions</h2>
	<ul type= disc style="padding-left:50px; padding-top:2px; text-align:justify;">
	<h4>For Dough:</h4>
	<li>500g (about 4 cups) all-purpose flour (or "00" flour if available)</li>
	<li>325ml (1? cups) warm water</li>
	<li>10g (2 teaspoons) salt</li>
	<li>7g (2 teaspoons) dry yeast</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to help yeast activate)</li>
	<h4>Toppings</h4>
	<li>200g (about 7 oz) San Marzano tomatoes (or any good-quality canned tomatoes)</li>

	<li>200g (7 oz) fresh mozzarella cheese (preferably mozzarella di bufala)</li>

	<li>A handful of fresh basil leaves</li>

	<li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>

	<li>Salt to taste</li>
	</ul>
<h2 style="padding-left:5px">Instructions</h2>
	<ul type= disc style="padding-left:50px; padding-top:2px; text-align:justify;">
	<li>Prepare the Dough:
In a small bowl, mix the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy. In a large bowl, 				combine the flour and salt. Gradually pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil, mixing continuously.
Once the dough starts to come together, knead it 			on a lightly floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it 		rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>

	</li>Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible (250°C/480°F or higher if your oven allows). If you have a pizza stone, place it 			in the oven to heat up.</li>
	<li>Prepare the Sauce:
Crush the San Marzano tomatoes with your hands or use a blender for a smoother texture.
Add a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil. 				You can also add a few basil leaves for extra flavor.</li>
	<li>Shape the Pizza:
Once the dough has risen, divide it into two portions (for two pizzas). Roll out each portion on a floured surface into a thin circle, about 12 		inches in diameter.
Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet sprinkled with flour or semolina.</li>

	<li>Add Toppings:
Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the pizza base.
Tear the mozzarella into pieces and scatter them over the sauce.
Add a few basil 				leaves and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</li>

	<li>Bake the Pizza:
Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling 			and slightly browned.</li.
	<li>Serve:
Once the pizza is out of the oven, garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Slice and enjoy!</li>
	</ul>

<h2 style="padding-left:5px">Instructions</h2>
	<ul type= disc style="padding-left:50px; padding-top:2px; text-align:justify;">
	<li> Cook the Pasta:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt (around 1 tablespoon per liter of water). It should taste 		like the sea.
Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (firm to the bite). This typically takes around 8-10 minutes, 		but check your specific pasta for timing.</li>

Once the pasta is al dente, reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the rest.
Add the cooked pasta to the tomato sauce. 		Toss everything together over low heat for 1-2 minutes, allowing the pasta to absorb some of the sauce.
If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the 		reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>

Plate the pasta and garnish with additional fresh basil leaves.
If desired, sprinkle with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
Drizzle with a little 		extra virgin olive oil for added flavor and shine.</li>

	<li>Prepare the Eggplant:
Slice the eggplants into ½ inch (1.25 cm) thick rounds.
Sprinkle salt over the slices and let them sit for about 30 minutes to release 		excess moisture. Pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
	<li>Bread the Eggplant:
Set up a breading station: one plate with flour, one bowl with plant-based milk, and one plate with breadcrumbs seasoned with salt and 		pepper.
Dip each eggplant slice into the flour, then the plant milk, and finally coat it in breadcrumbs. Repeat with all slices.</li>
	<li> Cook the Eggplant:
Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Fry the eggplant slices for about 3-4 minutes on each side until 		golden and crispy. Place them on paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
	<li> Make the Tomato Sauce:
In a saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes 		(do not brown).
Pour in the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the sauce thickens. Stir in the torn 		basil leaves towards the end.</li>
	<li>Prepare the Vegan Cheese (if using cashew cream):
Blend soaked cashews, water, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a high-speed blender 		until smooth and creamy. Set aside.</li>
	<li>Assemble the Parmigiana:
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom.
Add a layer of fried 		eggplant slices, followed by a generous spoonful of tomato sauce, then a layer of vegan mozzarella or cashew cream.
Repeat the layers until all 		ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.</li>
	<li>Bake the Dish:
Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
	<li> Serve:

<h2 style="padding-left:20px">Ingridients and Subsititutions</h2>
	<ul type= disc style="padding-left:50px; padding-top:2px; text-align:justify;">
	<li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti
</li>
	<li>4-5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
</li>
	<li>½ cup extra virgin olive oil
</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (or to taste)
</li>
	<li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
	<li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>

Freshly ground black pepper (optional)
</li>
	<li>Lemon zest (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
<h2 style="padding-left:5px">Instructions</h2>
	<ul type= disc style="padding-left:0px; padding-top:2px; text-align:justify;">
	<li>Cook the Pasta:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-10 		minutes).
Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the spaghetti.</li>
	<li> Prepare the Garlic and Oil:
While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the thinly sliced garlic and cook slowly, 				stirring frequently. The garlic should turn golden and become fragrant, but avoid burning it (this takes about 2-3 minutes).
Add the red pepper flakes 			and cook for another 30 seconds to infuse the oil with a bit of heat.</li>
	<li>Toss the Pasta with the Sauce:
Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic and oil.
Toss everything together over medium heat, making sure the 				spaghetti is coated evenly.
If the pasta seems dry, add a few tablespoons of the reserved pasta water to help the sauce adhere.</li>
	<li>Season and Garnish:
Season the pasta with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.
Add freshly chopped parsley and lemon zest for a bright, 				fresh flavor (optional).</li>
	<li>Serve:
Serve immediately, garnished with more parsley or an extra drizzle of olive oil if you like.</li>

	<li>2 medium zucchini
</li>
	<li>½ cup all-purpose flour (or a gluten-free flour alternative)

	<li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
	
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced
</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>

Grate the zucchini using a box grater or food processor.
Place the grated zucchini in a colander and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt to 			draw out excess moisture.
Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then use your hands or a clean kitchen towel to squeeze out as much water as possible. The 				drier the zucchini, the crispier the fritters will be.</li>
	<li>Make the Batter:
In a large bowl, combine the squeezed zucchini, flour, minced garlic, chopped onion (if using), black pepper, baking powder, and parsley 			or dill.
Add the flax egg (or regular egg) and mix well until all the ingredients are combined into a thick batter.</li>

Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Scoop 2-3 tablespoons of the zucchini mixture into the pan for each 			fritter, flattening them gently with a spatula.
Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy.
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate 			to drain excess oil.</li>
	<li>Serve:
Serve the zucchini fritters warm, with a side of vegan or regular yogurt, sour cream, or tzatziki for dipping.
Garnish with extra herbs if desired.</li>
